Just a little changement in splash boot and varius

### eggs-9.0.1
The first version of eggs fully functional on Debian, Devuan, Ubuntu and... Manjaro!!! And soon will come other distros of the Arch Linux family.

### eggs-9.0.0
* An Epiphany present! 

### eggs-9.0.0-BETA
* A Christmas present! 

A preview of eggs version 9.x! Even if the aspect remains substantially unchanged, internally a lot has changed: we have moved to node 16 and the new version of oclif. Everything has been done to create a way to manage even more distributions, not only Debian, Devuan, Ubuntu and derivatives, but also Fedora and Arch Linux. This version however does NOT yet include Fedora, nor Arch Linux, I have to solve the problems related to the use of dracut instead of initramfs-tools of Debian.

I wish You Merry Christmas and Happy New Year

### eggs-8.17-16
* tested against devuan beowulf, chiamaera, debian buster, bullseye, bookstorm, neon developer (ubuntu focal)

### eggs-8.17-15
* changement in --backup option and check it work, producing encrypted backup and restorings

### eggs-8.17-14
* refactoring and stabilization, added messages in issue and motd and remove then with calamares and krill

### eggs-8.17-13
* added calamares configuration no-display-manager, removed live-config and live-config-systemd in Debian bullseye, Devuan chimaera, Ubuntu focal and next

I must to check if removing live-config and live-config-systemd bring problems and check if it is possible to remove it in buster, and previous versions

### eggs-8.17-12
* added kali-rolling, added cli-autologin Devuan (sysvinit)

### eggs-8.17-11
* added Devuan daedalus, bugfix tools:stat, removed apt in favor of apt-get.

Hard tested on all Debian version from jessie to bookworm, i386 and amd64, installable with calamares or krill installers

### eggs-8.17-10
* added Devuan chimaera

I also cleaned the templates of the distros removing bullseye as it was just a copy of buster

### eggs-8.17-9
* removed npm package and localization, bugfixes in command eggs remove --autoremove

### eggs-8.17-8
* restored bionic compatubility

I worked in pacman: rewrote pacman.packages() for installation than removal.

### eggs-8.17-7
* live-config was reintroduced in package dependencies

I worked in pacman.links4Debs trying to reorder the code. Inserted in eggs config the display of the type of eggs package in use, corrected the isDebPackage(), isNpmPackage() functions in pacman. live-config is not taken because it's part of the version dependencies (bionic doesn't want it - but I should check)

### eggs-8.17-6
* added Debian 12 bookworm

Actually bullseye take all configuration from buster, simply a bit

### eggs-8.17-5
* added Ubuntu 22.04 jammy, paths to templates 

I modified in class ovary paths to templates from /usr/lib/penguins-eggs/conf/distros to right path /etc/penguins-eggs.d/distros. 

This can impact in many cases becouse most configurations distros are just a directory filled with links to buster or focal made from class pacman during installation

### eggs-8.17-4
* calamaresPolicies moved to Pacman, now eggs config configures calamares policies too

### eggs-8.17-3
* removed https check in axios.get(), it was generating error despite hpps://penguins-eggs.net certificate is correct

### eggs-8.17-2
* added ubuntu umpish in the list of compatible distros

### eggs-8.17-1
* building hen a debian bullseye xfce liveCD installable with all the necessary to build eggs from sources. 

### eggs-8.17-0 
* I toke version 8.0.28 and rebuild it to be compatible with node8.17. Actually it run in bullseye too, but We must to rebuild the changement from 8.0.30 to t.1.4

### Older versions 
You can find older versions on the [penguins-eggs repo](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs) under in **changelog-old.md** under **documents**

# Node8.17.0
I'm using actually node-8.17.0 version to build against all architectures (amd64, i386, arm64 and armel). Yes, there are same limits - compared with later versions of node - but it is the only way to release eggs for i386.
