* **xfce** - it's not naked, but just dressed with xfce4 and the tools to develop. (i386 and amd64)
* **lxqt** - it's not naked, but just dressed with lxqt and the tools to develop. (i386 and amd64)
* **cinnamon**  - was my personal version with cinnamon, mostly for development, but include common office tools; (amd64)
