# Proxmox-VE remastered ISOs
Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE; short PVE) is an open-source server virtualization management platform. It is a Debian-based Linux distribution and allows deployment and management of virtual machines and containers. Proxmox VE includes a web console and command-line tools, and provides a REST API for third-party tools. Two types of virtualization are supported: container-based with LXC (starting from version 4.0 replacing OpenVZ used in version up to 3.4, included), and full virtualization with KVM. It comes with a bare-metal installer and includes a web-based management interface.

All ISOs are based on Proxmox VE 6.3

# Proxmox VE 6.3

In the pve and incubator versions, there is a pre-configured VM with a TinyCore iso boot image, a Linux version with a 16 MB graphical user interface. 

You can see the virtual machine running simply by logging in as root on proxmox and booting it even without installing the system.

* **naked-ve** - just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution! (amd64)

* **pve** - it's not naked, but dressed with xfce4, developer's tools and virt-viewer (amd64)

* **incubator** - it's full workstation for virtualization, with cinnamon, libreoffice, gimp and tools. (amd64)
